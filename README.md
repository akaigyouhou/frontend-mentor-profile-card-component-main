## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

- I find it's hard to put the avatar in the right position. Finally, I set height of block structure and middle position of avatar to accomplish this task. I think there maybe better solution.
- I find the background cycle a little weird. I used background-position, background-size to put it to the right position. I am not sure this is the right method.
